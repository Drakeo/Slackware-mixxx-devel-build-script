chromaprint (audio fingerprint library)

Chromaprint is the core component of the Acoustid project.
It's a client-side library that implements a custom algorithm for
extracting fingerprints from any audio source.

ffmpeg is an optional dependency: it's used in place of fftw3 for
calcs and some extra tools are built. But it's *broken* ATM (so
it's disabled in the script).
