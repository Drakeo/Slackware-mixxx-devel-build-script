 Mixxx has an unusually broad community for an open-source project, encompassing performing musicians, C++ addicts,
 amateur DJs and even just casual users. The Mixxx Wiki contains useful information for users, developers, and artists, 
 and is summarized in the categories below. 
 
Mixxx was originally created in 2002 as part of a PhD thesis on new interfaces for DJing by Tue Haste Andersen.
After releasing the project as open source, dozens of contributors began modifying and improving Mixxx.

In 2006, a new development team lead by Adam Davison and Albert Santoni began reorganizing the project to ensure smooth growth 
of both the code-base and the number of contributors. A renewed focus on usability and stability has helped Mixxx grow to become 
the most popular free DJ software in the world, receiving over 1,000,000 downloads annually. Our committed team has worked hard to 
create great DJ software, and this growth is a sign of our success.

In 2011, RJ Ryan took over as Lead Developer to successfully continue the team?s endeavor to make Mixxx a world-class DJ software.

As our user community grows, so does our development team - Over 150 developers, artists, and translators have helped create Mixxx!
