For slackware14.2+ aka Slackware-15.0 Slackware-current the pulseaudio
and alsa-plugins builds are part of the build. 

I try to keep in sync with Slackware pretty much you may want to
blacklist pulseaudio and alsa-plugins.

For 2.2 or older read below
 Upgrading from 14.1 to 14.2  when released  or 14.1 to  for multi core usage. 
  You will need to rebuild qjacktl pulseaudio
 or any other programs you compiled against jack-connection-kit. 
add puulseaudio and dependencies 

Friendly note you may want to recompile Pipewire rebuild it with
Jackd ability same for SSR Simple Screen Recorder.
This way you can record and stream to websites at the same time.

Or you can just use my jack-pulse-sink https://github.com/Drakeo/jack-pulse-sink
 That is already part of my MIXXX-Build.
