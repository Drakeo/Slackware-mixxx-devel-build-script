ok with my build we build with slackbuilds vamp plugins
and we need to make sure the /usr/lib(Arch)/mixxx/plugin/libmixxxminimal.so is in 
 /usr/lib(Arch)/vamp/libmixxxminimal.so My build does that  but Slackbuilds may not.

 Things to do as root for root or any user. 
 setting up set_rlimits here is my config.
 I run Mixxx as root 99 percent of the time. 
 this is me and the system is built for one thing real time.
 
 
# Configuration file for set_rlimits.  Format is:
#
#   name   program   max_nice_priority  max_realtime_priority
# or
#   name   program   <key>=<value> ...
#
# name is expected to be a username, a groupname if preceeded by a @ sign,
# or ALL (which matches all users).  Negative priorities effectively
# disallow any setting of the respective priority for the matching entry. 
# <key> can be rtprio, nice or memlock.
# Example entry:
#
#   mark  /usr/local/bin/jackd  -1  80
#
# Here, user mark can execute /usr/local/bin/jackd using set_rlimits to set
# a realtime priority up to and including 80, but setting of a nice priority
# through set_rlimits is disallowed.  Alternatively, if an `audio' group
# existed, the entry
#
#   @audio  /usr/local/bin/jackd  -1  80
#
# would allow the same except the permission would extend to all members of
# the `audio' group.  The same effect could be achieved with the key/value
# syntax:
#
#   @audio  /usr/local/bin/jackd  nice=-1  rtprio=80
#
# For more details on the format and use of this file please refer to
# the set_rlimits manual page.
 root /usr/bin/mixxx  soft rtprio 99 
 
 ok now lets fix the problem with wavy choppy voice it is a acapi proble.
 
and can be found in mixxx trouble shoot wiki. http://www.mixxx.org/wiki/doku.php/troubleshooting?s[]=limits

Disable CPU Frequency Scaling or use the 'Performance' mode.
CPU Frequency Scaling is a main cause of Mixxx skipping on laptops.
(Do ps aux | grep cpufreq and kill any processes you find.) 

Actually it is better to remove the kernel modules, do `lsmod | grep freq` 
and then remove each of the modules using rmmod, note that if you are using
a notebook it will burn through battery much quicker when doing this. 

so I made a start up script named mixxxstart and put it in my /usr/local/bin

#!/bin/sh
# script to stop the cpu scaling it messes with mixxx
rmmod acpi_cpufreq
mixxx

this solved my huge issue with the slackware 14.1
